6. You will be prompted to Login again, however you _**WILL NOT** use the same credentials used in the first login_. Instead, in this case, **you should use your Yale University NETID and Password**. If you are unable to log into the data service, you will need to return to the previous screen and reopen the map to try again. If your NETID and Password do not seem to be working, try entering your **NETID** as **"YALE\NETID"** so that the App recognises that you are trying to log into the Yale domain.
7. Once you see the Tree Data Points appear in the **Work Area screen**, you should Pan & Zoom (this works as you would expect on a touch screen, with pinching, etc...) to the area you will be working in and click on the **CHOOSE MAP DETAIL** link.
8. In the **Map Detail screen**, Zoom to the highest level of detail possible (or necessary) and click on the **DOWNLOAD** link to begin the download.
9. To open the Street Tree Editor, click on the Thumbnail for the Map in the **All Maps** screen.
10. The Street Tree Editor will open and the GPS will immediately be used (click yes if you are prompted to turn on the GPS) to center the map on your current location.
